WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   curState[1]_PWR_6_o_Mux_71_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

      Number using O6 output only:             172
      Number using O5 output only:              42
      Number using O5 and O6:                   82
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    91 out of   2,278    3%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       128 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          300
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           142 out of     300   47%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of     300    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         155 out of     300   51%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              20 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
